# Cursor Demo Presentation Guide

## Quick Reference for Presenters

### Demo Overview (20-25 minutes total)
This demo shows four key Cursor capabilities through hands-on scenarios.

### Pre-Demo Setup
1. Ensure Cursor is installed and configured
2. Have this repository open in Cursor
3. Test internet connection for AI responses
4. Prepare terminal window for running code

### Scenario Flow

#### 1. Markdown to Code (5-6 minutes)
- **File**: `scenario1_markdown_to_code/specification.md`
- **Key Message**: "Specifications become working code"
- **Demo**: Copy spec, ask Cursor to implement, show generated code
- **Highlight**: Complete implementation from natural language

#### 2. Bug Hunt (4-5 minutes)  
- **File**: `scenario2_bug_hunt/before/data_processor.py`
- **Key Message**: "AI finds and fixes multiple bug types"
- **Demo**: Run broken code, ask Cursor to analyze and fix
- **Highlight**: Pattern recognition and comprehensive debugging

#### 3. Feature Evolution (6-7 minutes)
- **File**: `scenario3_feature_evolution/specification.md`
- **Key Message**: "Build features iteratively through conversation" 
- **Demo**: Start simple, evolve through 6 iterations
- **Highlight**: Natural development flow and code adaptation

#### 4. Project Bootstrap (7-8 minutes)
- **File**: `scenario4_project_bootstrap/project_idea.md`
- **Key Message**: "Turn ideas into structured projects"
- **Demo**: Idea to full project architecture and implementation
- **Highlight**: Holistic planning and production-ready scaffolding

### Key Talking Points

#### What Makes Cursor Powerful
- **Context Understanding**: Reads and understands entire codebases
- **Natural Language**: Communicate in plain English, not technical jargon
- **Complete Solutions**: Generates full implementations, not just snippets
- **Best Practices**: Incorporates industry standards automatically
- **Iterative Refinement**: Easy to adjust and improve results

#### Success Tips to Share
1. **Be Specific**: Detailed requirements get better results
2. **Provide Context**: Reference existing code and files
3. **Iterate Gradually**: Make small improvements over time
4. **Ask Questions**: Cursor can explain its reasoning
5. **Test Everything**: Always validate AI-generated code

### Common Audience Questions

**"Is the generated code production-ready?"**
- Generally high quality but always needs review
- Great for scaffolding and boilerplate
- Business logic may need refinement

**"What about security concerns?"**
- AI can implement security best practices
- Still need security reviews for sensitive applications
- Helps identify common security patterns

**"How does it compare to GitHub Copilot?"**
- More conversational and context-aware
- Better for architectural decisions and planning
- Stronger at understanding project-wide context

**"What are the limitations?"**
- Requires good internet connection
- Quality depends on prompt clarity
- Domain-specific knowledge may be limited
- Still need to understand the generated code

### Demo Tips

#### Before Starting
- Explain that responses may vary slightly
- Mention that you'll show the process, not perfect results
- Set expectations about timing (AI responses take 10-30 seconds)

#### During Demo  
- Read prompts aloud before submitting
- Explain what you expect before showing results
- Point out specific code patterns and decisions
- Don't panic if results differ from expected - adapt and explain

#### Handling Issues
- If Cursor gives unexpected results, ask it to explain or revise
- Use clarifying questions to guide better results
- Show how iteration improves outcomes
- Emphasize that this is normal development workflow

### Closing Message
"Cursor transforms development from writing code to describing what you want built. It handles the technical implementation details while you focus on solving business problems. The key is learning to communicate effectively with AI - just like working with a very capable junior developer who needs clear direction."

### Next Steps for Audience
1. Try Cursor with their own projects
2. Start with simple specifications and build up
3. Practice iterative refinement techniques
4. Experiment with different prompt styles
5. Join the Cursor community for tips and best practices

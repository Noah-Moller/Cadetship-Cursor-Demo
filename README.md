# Cursor AI Assistant Demo

This repository contains practical examples for demonstrating how to use Cursor AI Assistant effectively. Each demo scenario is designed to be walked through live to show different Cursor capabilities.

## Demo Structure

This demo is organized into scenarios that showcase different aspects of Cursor:

1. **Markdown to Code** - Show how specifications become working code
2. **Bug Fixing** - Demonstrate AI-assisted debugging
3. **Iterative Development** - Show how to build features step by step
4. **Project Planning** - Let AI help structure and plan projects

## How to Use This Demo

Each scenario folder contains:
- `specification.md` - A markdown file describing what to build
- `before/` - Starting code with intentional issues (where applicable)
- `after/` - Expected final result
- `walkthrough.md` - Step-by-step demo script

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Markdown to Code
Show how you can write a specification in markdown and have Cursor implement it.

**Demo Script**: "I have this specification. Watch me tell Cursor to implement it."

### Scenario 2: Bug Hunt
Start with broken code and use Cursor to identify and fix multiple types of bugs.

**Demo Script**: "This code has several bugs. Let me show you how Cursor helps find and fix them."

### Scenario 3: Feature Evolution
Build a simple feature and then iteratively improve it based on requirements.

**Demo Script**: "Let's start simple and see how Cursor helps us evolve this feature."

### Scenario 4: Project Bootstrap
Use Cursor to plan and create the initial structure for a new project.

**Demo Script**: "I have an idea. Let's see how Cursor helps me turn it into a structured project."

## Running the Demos

1. Navigate to any scenario folder
2. Follow the walkthrough.md instructions
3. Use the specification.md files as prompts to Cursor
4. Compare results with the after/ examples

## Key Cursor Techniques Demonstrated

- Natural language specifications
- Iterative refinement
- Context-aware debugging
- Code generation from requirements
- Project structure planning
- Test-driven development with AI

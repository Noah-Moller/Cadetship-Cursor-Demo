# Project Idea: Recipe Recommendation API

## Concept
Build a REST API that recommends recipes based on available ingredients and dietary preferences.

## High-Level Goals
- Users can input ingredients they have
- System suggests recipes that can be made with those ingredients
- Support dietary filters (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- Include recipe ratings and cooking time
- Provide nutritional information

## Business Requirements
- Fast response times (under 200ms)
- Support for 10,000+ recipes
- User preference learning over time
- Mobile-friendly JSON API
- Basic user authentication

## Technical Constraints
- Python-based backend
- RESTful API design
- Database for recipe storage
- Deployable on cloud platforms
- Comprehensive testing

## Success Metrics
- Response time under 200ms
- 95% test coverage
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Recipe recommendation accuracy above 80%

This is just the initial idea - we'll let Cursor help us plan the technical implementation and project structure.

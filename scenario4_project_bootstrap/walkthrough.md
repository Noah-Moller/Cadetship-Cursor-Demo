# Scenario 4 Walkthrough: Project Bootstrap

## Demo Script

### Setup (30 seconds)
1. Open the `project_idea.md` file
2. Say to audience: "I have an idea for a recipe API. Let me show you how Cursor helps me turn this concept into a structured project plan and initial implementation."

### The Demo (7-8 minutes)

#### Step 1: Project Planning
**What to say**: "First, let's ask Cursor to help us plan this project properly."

**Cursor prompt**:
```
Looking at this project idea, help me create a comprehensive project plan. I need:
1. Technical architecture recommendations
2. Project structure and file organization
3. Technology stack suggestions
4. Development phases and milestones
5. Database schema design

Consider best practices for Python API development and scalability requirements.
```

**Expected result**: Detailed project analysis with architecture recommendations.

#### Step 2: Create Project Structure
**What to say**: "Now let's have Cursor create the actual project structure."

**Cursor prompt**:
```
Based on your recommendations, create the complete project structure for this recipe API. Include:
- Directory structure with all necessary folders
- Configuration files (requirements.txt, .env template, etc.)
- Basic API structure with placeholder endpoints
- Database models
- Docker configuration for development
- README with setup instructions
```

#### Step 3: Implement Core Models
**What to say**: "Let's start implementing the core data models."

**Cursor prompt**:
```
Implement the database models for recipes, ingredients, users, and dietary preferences. Use SQLAlchemy with proper relationships, indexes, and constraints. Include model validation and helpful methods.
```

#### Step 4: Create API Endpoints
**What to say**: "Now let's build the main API endpoints."

**Cursor prompt**:
```
Create the main API endpoints using FastAPI:
1. POST /recipes/search - find recipes by ingredients
2. GET /recipes/{id} - get recipe details
3. POST /users/preferences - update user dietary preferences
4. GET /recipes/recommendations - personalized recommendations

Include proper request/response models, error handling, and API documentation.
```

#### Step 5: Add Business Logic
**What to say**: "Let's implement the recipe matching algorithm."

**Cursor prompt**:
```
Implement the recipe recommendation logic. Create a service that:
- Matches recipes based on available ingredients
- Applies dietary filters
- Scores recipes by ingredient match percentage
- Considers user preferences and ratings
- Returns results sorted by relevance
```

#### Step 6: Testing Setup
**What to say**: "Finally, let's set up comprehensive testing."

**Cursor prompt**:
```
Create a complete testing setup including:
- Unit tests for models and services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Test fixtures with sample data
- Test configuration and database setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
```

### Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Holistic Planning**: Cursor considers architecture, not just code
2. **Best Practices**: Incorporates industry standards automatically
3. **Complete Implementation**: Creates full project structure, not just snippets
4. **Scalability Awareness**: Considers performance and growth requirements
5. **Production Ready**: Includes testing, documentation, and deployment configs

### Project Aspects Demonstrated

1. **Architecture Design**: API structure, database design, service layers
2. **Technology Selection**: Choosing appropriate libraries and frameworks
3. **Project Organization**: Logical file structure and module separation
4. **Development Workflow**: Testing, documentation, and deployment setup
5. **Code Quality**: Type hints, error handling, validation

### Development Phases Shown

1. **Planning Phase**: Architecture and technology decisions
2. **Foundation Phase**: Project structure and core models
3. **Implementation Phase**: API endpoints and business logic
4. **Quality Phase**: Testing and documentation
5. **Deployment Phase**: Configuration and CI/CD setup

### Common Questions and Answers

**Q**: "How detailed should the initial project idea be?"
**A**: "Even high-level ideas work well. Cursor asks clarifying questions and makes reasonable assumptions."

**Q**: "Can it handle complex architectural decisions?"
**A**: "Yes, it considers scalability, maintainability, and industry best practices when making recommendations."

**Q**: "What if I disagree with some of its choices?"
**A**: "You can ask it to revise specific aspects or explain its reasoning. It's very flexible."

**Q**: "How complete is the generated code?"
**A**: "It creates production-ready scaffolding that you can build upon. Most boilerplate is handled automatically."

### Demo Conclusion

**What to say**: "In just a few minutes, we went from a simple idea to a complete, structured project with:
- Proper architecture and project organization
- Database models with relationships
- REST API endpoints with documentation
- Business logic implementation
- Comprehensive testing setup
- Deployment configuration

This would typically take hours or days to set up manually, but Cursor helped us bootstrap everything in minutes. From here, you'd iterate and refine the implementation based on specific requirements."

## Complete Demo Wrap-Up

**Final summary**: "We've seen four key ways Cursor transforms development:

1. **Specification to Code**: Turn detailed requirements into working implementations
2. **Intelligent Debugging**: Quickly identify and fix multiple types of bugs
3. **Iterative Development**: Evolve features naturally through conversation
4. **Project Bootstrapping**: Plan and create entire project structures

The key to success with Cursor is clear communication about what you want to achieve. The more context and specific requirements you provide, the better the results."
